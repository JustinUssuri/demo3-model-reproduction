# Demo3 – Reproduction Target (locked)

Chosen model: PyPSA-GB

Rationale:
- Smaller geographic scope → higher probability of full reproduction
- Clear system narrative (generation, demand, network constraints)
- Methods and modeling choices are transferable beyond the UK context

Decision date: YYYY-MM-DD
This choice will not be revisited unless reproduction is completed.


## Understanding
- What problem is the model solving (planning / dispatch / expansion)?
- What assumptions are explicit vs implicit?
- Why DC instead of AC (or vice versa)?
- What are the main limitations / failure modes?

## Reproduction
- What inputs are required (data, network, time series)?
- What outputs should match (tables/figures/metrics)?
- What is the minimal “works” criterion for v0.1?
