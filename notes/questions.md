# Demo3 Questions (living list)

## Model selection
- What specific model/paper am I reproducing?
- What is the smallest reproducible core?

## Understanding
- What problem is the model solving (planning / dispatch / expansion)?
- What assumptions are explicit vs implicit?
- Why DC instead of AC (or vice versa)?
- What are the main limitations / failure modes?

## Reproduction
- What inputs are required (data, network, time series)?
- What outputs should match (tables/figures/metrics)?
- What is the minimal “works” criterion for v0.1?
