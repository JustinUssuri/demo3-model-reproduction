# Demo3 v0.1 Scope – PyPSA-GB

## Goal
Produce a minimal, verifiable reproduction of PyPSA-GB
that demonstrates understanding of modeling choices.

## v0.1 MUST include
- A working environment that runs PyPSA-GB (or a minimal subset)
- Reproduction of ONE key output (figure, table, or metric) from the reference
- A written explanation covering:
  - Problem definition
  - Why DC power flow is used
  - Core assumptions and limitations

## v0.1 MUST NOT include
- Adding new features or improvements
- Scaling to larger regions or longer time horizons
- Performance optimization
- Comparison with other models (Eur, Plexos, etc.)

## Definition of "Done"
Someone familiar with power system modeling can:
- Run the reproduction
- See the key output
- Understand the modeling logic and trade-offs
