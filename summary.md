## 1. Problem
This project uses a minimal transmission-style system to examine whether decision-relevant signals derived from DC LOPF (e.g., thermal-limit screening and qualitative system stress trends) remain consistent when checked against AC power flow as the system is pushed toward higher loading. Stress is induced by increasing wind availability (alpha), which tends to increase injections and loading pressure on a fixed, small network. The question is explicitly decision-level: do DC-based signals about which lines or interfaces become stressed remain reliable as the system is pushed, rather than exact flow accuracy.

## 2. Method (high-level)
A small 3-bus, 2-line network is constructed with a wind generator at the north bus, a dispatchable gas generator at the south bus (acting as the slack in AC power flow), and loads at the middle and south buses. For each case in a parameter sweep, alpha scales wind availability while loads and line ratings remain fixed. A DC LOPF is solved in PyPSA to obtain dispatch and DC line flows, after which an AC power flow (PF, not OPF) is run in PyPSA using the DC dispatch as an initial point. The comparison focuses on line-flow differences (absolute and relative) and agreement in thermal-limit binding classification, where a line is flagged as constrained based on its loading relative to its rating.

## 3. Observations
In the reported sweep, AC power flow converges in all cases. DC and AC line-flow differences tend to increase as alpha rises, indicating larger deviations under higher loading, but relative errors remain modest within the reported range for this toy system. Line loading increases with alpha and remains below thermal limits throughout the sweep; both DC and AC therefore flag no thermal-limit binding for all lines in the reported cases. For this toy network and modest stress range, DC-based pre-congestion screening signals and qualitative stress trends align with AC power-flow checks.

## 4. Limitations
The model is a toy 3-bus, 2-line system with two generators and fixed loads; it is not representative of real transmission networks. There is no time coupling, uncertainty, unit commitment, reserves, contingencies, or dynamic behavior; only single-snapshot cases are analyzed. The comparison is limited to DC LOPF flows versus AC power-flow results using the same dispatch and does not evaluate AC OPF redispatch, voltage feasibility under binding constraints, reactive power limits, or stability margins. No claim of system-level generalization is made.

## 5. Implications / Next Steps
This experiment is best viewed as a methodological sanity check. The same workflow can be extended to larger networks, additional stressors (e.g., higher loads, different transfer directions, tighter line ratings), and broader parameter sweeps that enter binding regimes. Incorporating AC OPF or redispatch, contingency analysis, and systematic sensitivity tests would better probe when DC-based planning conclusions begin to break down. The current results serve as a stepping stone toward those more comprehensive studies, not a final answer.
